# meeting-exercise

You have been tasked with creating a meeting scheduling API. Complete as many of the pre-defined endpoints in the application as time permits.  Along the way, we may provide additional requirements or ask for changes to your design (agile!).

Your solution must incorporate the following:

1. Entity Framework (with Code-First migrations!)
1. Dependency injection (use the container of your choice, or pure DI if you prefer!)
1. Database (Utilize any relational database of your choosing)
1. use curl, Postman or some other rest tool to prove your endpoints work.
1. Incorporate SOLID principles and maintain a clean architecture (feel free to refactor, add or remove projects)
1. Domain objects have been provided, feel free to modify existing objects or add new ones
1. Utilize interfaces and abstractions to facilitate unit testing and code flexibility.


Feel free to utilize Google, Stack Overflow or any other resources. We firmly believe in the adage "use your brain as a processor, not as a harddrive". We don't expect you to know everything from memory and we want to evaluate your resourcefulness and problem solving skills.

Because our time is limited, you are not expected to complete all endpoints of this application. You may be redirected to work on specific areas of the application as we prioritize the work to be done and what we wish to evaluate. This is in no way a reflection how you are doing.

Do not hesitate to ask questions or request help if you get stuck. This is an evaluation, but working through problems with peers is a skill too.
